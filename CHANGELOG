Version 1.1.1

Changes:
Changed filenames to be more accurate:
-Bank.java -> ChargeFileManager.java
-BankInterface.java -> ChargeInterface.java
-BankOpInterface.java -> ChargeOpInterface.java

Interface classes no longer extend ChargeFileManager.java. This was done to make ChargeFileManager.java
more of a general-purpose class to operate on the database that will be used wen the web 
application is developed. The interface subclasses won't be needed for that.

ChargeViewer.java class created to contain console UI display methods used by both interface classes.

Both interface classes inherit this class. This means that ChargeOpInterface.java doesn't inherit 
unneeded methods from ChargeInterface.java like selectAccount() and selectMonth().
